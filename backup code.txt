                I don't have any prior coding experience other than the start of a unreal engine Udemy course.<br /> knowing how to code websites would allow me to work form home and it sounds like a heck of a lot more fun that washing dishes.

                    <p>I'm just a normal guy, I haven't really achieved anything too exciting. I graduated highschool and moved out of my parents house and now im trying to develope skills.<br />
                    I guess I'm pretty good at CSGO, but that isn't all that exciting, from what ive heard it sounds like Matthew Lindly is pretty good at shooters.</p>

            <p>
                learning more complex languages like c++ or c# is something I want to do after finishing this course so I could build games<br />
                In general my "big end goal" is to build my own self-sustaing earth-ship (a type of home) and develope some passive income however posible, wehter thru crypto-mining or videogames.
