  <h1>Solomon Findley Dietz</h1>
  <h3>
    My name is Solomon Findley Dietz, I am a 19 year-old living in Gering Nebraska<br />
  </h3>
  <p>
    I don't have any prior coding experience other than the start of a unreal engine Udemy course.<br /> knowing how
    to code websites would allow me to work form home and it sounds like a heck of a lot more fun that washing
    dishes.

  <h2>
    Achievements
  </h2>
  <p>I'm just a normal guy, I haven't really achieved anything too exciting. I graduated highschool and moved out
    of my parents house and now im trying to develope skills.<br />
    I guess I'm pretty good at CSGO, but that isn't all that exciting, from what ive heard it sounds like Matthew
    Lindly is pretty good at shooters.</p>

  <h2>
    Goals after Array
  </h2>
  <p>
    learning more complex languages like c++ or c# is something I want to do after finishing this course so I could
    build games<br />
    In general my "big end goal" is to build my own self-sustaining earth-ship (a type of home) and develope some
    passive income however possible, wether through crypto-mining or videogames.
